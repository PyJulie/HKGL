by Lie Ju, Zhen Yu, Lin Wang, Xin Zhao, Xin Wang, Paul Bonnington, and Zongyuan Ge*

## Intro.
This is an official Pytorch implementation of our paper published in IEEE TMI 2023.

Hierarchical Knowledge Guided Learning for Real-world Retinal Disease Recognition.

[*[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210137)*], [*[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08913)*]

The codes have been released! We have also provided other widely-used tricks for long-tailed learning. Feel free to use them!
